# Agux's Animal Photos Gallery

Little frontend web project meant to show Animal photos on a web browser.
It was made as a final project for a course and features responsive design by using 3 media queries for proper sizing of 3 different aspect ratios.
A button on the upper-left corner embedded with an svg image was implemented to switch between 2 different sets of photos.
The webpage was planned as a "mobile first" site.
The site is hosted on https://aguxone.pythonanywhere.com/ for a quick view of the final result.
